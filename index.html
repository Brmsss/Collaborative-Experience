                                        Hi All, my name is Bramantio Alif Perdana from Informatics, with student number 235410078. I want to share my collaborative experience with my team during my internship program at LPMP (Lembaga Penjaminan Mutu Pendidikan Kalimantan Barat).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My friends and I from my previous university took part in an internship program run by the institution at the end of 2021 during our fifth semester. The four of us in my group at the time were myself, Reza, Angga, and Sahdiki.
                                        Mr. Pujo was one of the mentors for us during the internship program at LPMP West Kalimantan. He was also a graduate of the university we previously attended.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At LPMP West Kalimantan, there is a guesthouse designed to accommodate visitors from outside Pontianak who are engaged in long-term activities at LPMP West Kalimantan. However, during our internship, the guesthouse was repurposed to serve as a facility for COVID-19 patients' self-isolation.
                                        The guesthouse management was overwhelmed with the task of organizing the available rooms, prompting our mentor to assign us the task of creating a website to help alleviate the workload of the guesthouse management.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Each of us had our own tasks. Some worked on the UI/UX design, while others focused on the front-end and back-end development. The UI/UX design was managed by Reza. He created a very appealing UI/UX design, which was then implemented on the website to be developed.
                                        After creating the UI/UX design, the next step is to develop the front-end of the website. The front-end was managed by Sahdiki. He was responsible for developing the appearance and interaction between the user and the website. 
                                        After that, the work was continued by the back-end developers, which were Me and Angga. Angga and I created and developed the database and programming logic related to the guesthouse website at LPMP. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the developed website was finished, we gave the guesthouse management a presentation. The guesthouse management highly appreciated our work and expressed gratitude for assisting in lightening their workload in managing the guesthouse. He provided some minor revisions to the website, which he believed would enhance its quality.
                                    </p>
